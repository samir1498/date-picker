# Date Picker Project

This is a simple Date Picker project implemented in TypeScript, powered by Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS, and using pnpm for package management. The project showcases functional programming principles and allows users to interact with a date picker, navigate through months, and select a date.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samir1498/date-picker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd date-picker
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Using pnpm
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   # Using pnpm
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the date picker.

## Usage

- Use the "Next Month" and "Previous Month" buttons to navigate through months.
- Click on a date to select it. The selected date will be displayed in the button.

## Project Structure

- `src/main.ts`: The entry point of the application that initializes the date picker.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: A fast development server and build tool for modern web apps.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
